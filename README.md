# dePAK
packer/unpacker for the newer .PAK files from the PS Vita version of CatSystem2

code isn't the best, if you have any suggestions to make it better please let me know in an issue.

Only tested with the Vita version of [Amatsutsumi](https://vndb.org/r55756), should work with other VNs that use the same engine that were created around the same time

for older games (e.g. Grisaia no Kajitsu) use [unPAK](https://github.com/NameSubjecttoChange/unPAK)

## TODO
- [x] unpack
- [x] repack
- [ ] repacking from scratch (currently requires original .PAK file)
- [ ] unpack script
- [ ] repack script
