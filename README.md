# dePAK
packer/unpacker for the newer .PAK files from the PS Vita version of CatSystem2

still very WIP, hacked everything together in a few hours so code is still bad very ;w;

Only tested with the Vita version of [Amatsutsumi](https://vndb.org/r55756), should work with other VNs that use the same engine that were created around the same time

for older games (e.g. Grisaia no Kajitsu) use [unPAK](https://github.com/NameSubjecttoChange/unPAK)

# TODO
add support for repacking PAK files and script (only unpacking works for now)
